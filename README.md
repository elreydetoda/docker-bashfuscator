# Dockerized Bashfusctator (Unofficial)
## Project

The [Bashfuscator](https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator) seems like a really cool project, and I love what they are doing with it.

## This repo
I figured since every linux distro (_I believe_) can run docker, and since more and more things are getting pushed to the cloud. I figured why not dockerize the Bashfuscator tool, so it is portable and people don't even have to run python (even though linux should come with it by default). This allow the barrier to entry even lower, and let people play around with it and not have to install anything.

I hope to have have the project fork this repo and they could maintain it, and possibly if they want to use the same docker image for development, but till then. Till then this is my random idea, and this is **UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION**, don't think this is even close to finished yet. :smile:
